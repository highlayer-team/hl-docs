# Magic values

The values presented below are essential for the network, including sequencer parameters, p2p seeds, and public Highlayerd node hosted by Highlayer maintainers.

Seed node: `https://seed-node.highlayer.io/`

Sequencer URL: `https://sequencer.highlayer.io/`

Public node: `https://node-1.highlayer.io/`

Sequencer public key: `dfc8bae0eabca59ff57d4e76a7eb3bf817e0466c4c9db58c7d6f79c83b4c1aae`

Note that the public node might implement rate limits; it's strongly recommended to make the highlayerd node configurable in your dApp, not relying solely on the public node.

If you maintain a popular dApp on highlayer, it's also recommended that you host your own highlayer node as the default node for your dApp.
