# Magic values

The values presented below are essential for the network, including sequencer parameters, p2p seeds, and public Highlayerd node hosted by Highlayer maintainers.

Seed node: `seed-testnet.highlayer.io`

Sequencer URL: `https://sequencer-testnet.highlayer.io/`

Public node: `https://node-1.highlayer.io/`

Sequencer public key: `dfc8bae0eabca59ff57d4e76a7eb3bf817e0466c4c9db58c7d6f79c83b4c1aae`

Note that public node might implement ratelimits, it's strongly recommended to make highlayerd node configurable in your dApp, not relying solely on public node.

If you maintain popular dApp on highlayer, it's also recommended to host own highlayer node as default node for your dApp.
